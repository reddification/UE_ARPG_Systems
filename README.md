# UE_ARPG_Systems
This repository is, basically, just a subset of plugins that I've developed for a project I'm working on. It's intended only to let those who are interested to understand what kind of things I develop. 
Most of these plugins are not standalone i.e. they either depend on some other of my plugins that are not included in the repository, or they are dependent on some other open source plugins (like FlorGraph, for example).

A playable example that contains code from these plugins:

P.S. In that build (and project) I developed only gameplay part. I didn't make any of 3d/art/environment/music/SFXs/VFXs. 
Used plugins: FlowGraph, DialogueTree by Unraed, EMS, Ultra Dynamic Sky and Weather, Advanced Third Person Camera, NPC optimizer
